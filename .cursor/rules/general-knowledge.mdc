# Project name: Match Genius

## What is it?: 
* This is an app that uses AI to generate pick up lines for men to date women.
* The users will copy the message provided by the app, then they can paste in their own dating apps.

## How does it work?:
* The user will enter some information regarding their dating prospects into the chat box. 
* An api using a special prompt designed to understand the woman's profile will send a request to the desired AI Provider (that could be either Anthropic, OpenAI or DeepSeek)
* Then the app will receive the response containing the curated "message" that the user needs to answer to the girl. 
* Then the user provides new messages from the girl and the app returns his curated responses.

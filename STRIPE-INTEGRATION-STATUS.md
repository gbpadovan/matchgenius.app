# Stripe Integration Status and Fixes

## Overview

This document outlines the current status of the Stripe integration in the MatchGenius app, the fixes implemented, and the next steps required to fully resolve subscription-related issues.

## Current Status

The Stripe integration is partially working but has several issues that were addressed in the `supabase-stripe` branch:

1. **Webhook Handling**: Webhook events from Stripe were being received but not properly processed due to 307 redirects and authentication issues.
2. **Subscription Data Transformation**: The subscription data retrieved from the database wasn't being properly transformed for the UI.
3. **Subscription Status Detection**: The logic to determine if a user is subscribed was too strict and didn't handle edge cases well.

## Implemented Fixes

### 1. Webhook Handler Improvements

- Added a GET handler to the webhook endpoint to prevent 307 redirects
- Improved logging to better track subscription events
- Fixed TypeScript errors related to event object handling

```typescript
// Add this to ensure the webhook handler doesn't require authentication
export const GET = async () => {
  return new Response('Stripe webhook endpoint is working', {
    status: 200,
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'text/plain',
    },
  });
};
```

### 2. Subscription API Endpoint Enhancement

- Updated the subscription API endpoint to properly transform database data to client format
- Added detailed logging to track subscription data flow

```typescript
// Transform the subscription data from Supabase format to client format
if (subscription) {
  const transformedSubscription = {
    id: subscription.id,
    userId: subscription.user_id,
    stripeCustomerId: subscription.stripe_customer_id,
    stripeSubscriptionId: subscription.stripe_subscription_id,
    stripePriceId: subscription.stripe_price_id,
    stripeCurrentPeriodEnd: subscription.stripe_current_period_end,
    status: subscription.status,
    createdAt: subscription.created_at,
    updatedAt: subscription.updated_at
  };
  
  console.log('Subscription API: Transformed subscription data:', transformedSubscription);
  return NextResponse.json(transformedSubscription);
}
```

### 3. Improved Subscription Status Detection

- Enhanced the `isSubscribed` function to better handle subscription status
- Added more detailed logging to diagnose subscription status issues
- Made the function more resilient to different data formats

```typescript
const isSubscribed = (() => {
  // Add debug logging to help diagnose issues
  console.log('Checking subscription status:', {
    hasSubscription: !!subscription,
    subscriptionId: subscription?.stripeSubscriptionId,
    periodEnd: subscription?.stripeCurrentPeriodEnd,
    status: subscription?.status
  });
  
  if (!subscription) return false;
  if (!subscription.stripeSubscriptionId) return false;
  
  // If we have a subscription ID from Stripe, consider it valid
  // This is a more reliable indicator than checking period end dates
  if (subscription.status === 'active' || subscription.status === 'trialing') {
    return true;
  }
  
  // Fallback to checking period end date if status is not available
  if (subscription.stripeCurrentPeriodEnd) {
    try {
      // Handle different date formats safely
      const periodEnd = subscription.stripeCurrentPeriodEnd instanceof Date 
        ? subscription.stripeCurrentPeriodEnd 
        : new Date(subscription.stripeCurrentPeriodEnd);
      
      if (isNaN(periodEnd.getTime())) {
        console.error('Invalid date format for subscription period end:', subscription.stripeCurrentPeriodEnd);
        return false;
      }
      
      return periodEnd.getTime() > Date.now();
    } catch (e) {
      console.error('Error calculating subscription status:', e);
      return false;
    }
  }
  
  return false;
})();
```

### 4. Server-Side Authentication Utility

- Created a new server-side authentication utility to fix issues with the checkout route
- Fixed import errors in the checkout route

```typescript
// Server-side authentication utility function
export async function auth() {
  const cookieStore = await cookies();
  
  const supabase = createServerClient(
    process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL!,
    process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY!,
    {
      cookies: {
        get(name: string) {
          return cookieStore.get(name)?.value;
        },
        set(name: string, value: string, options: any) {
          cookieStore.set({ name, value, ...options });
        },
        remove(name: string, options: any) {
          cookieStore.set({ name, value: '', ...options });
        },
      },
    }
  );
  
  // Get the session
  const { data: { session } } = await supabase.auth.getSession();
  
  if (!session) {
    return null;
  }
  
  // Get the user
  const { data: { user } } = await supabase.auth.getUser();
  
  if (!user) {
    return null;
  }
  
  return {
    user: {
      id: user.id,
      email: user.email,
      name: user.user_metadata?.name || null,
    },
    session
  };
}
```

## Current Problem

The main issue appears to be that **subscription data is not being properly stored in the Supabase database** when webhook events are received from Stripe. Through testing, we've confirmed that:

1. The user (test1@test.com with ID 00705e1f-8404-4243-82cf-6700791dbf36) has an active subscription in Stripe with ID `sub_1RJgouDzOSai7kJlWAUGusYl`.
2. However, this subscription is not being properly reflected in the Supabase database.
3. The webhook events from Stripe are being received (as seen in the logs) but may not be properly processing the subscription data.

## Next Steps

1. **Verify Database Schema**: Ensure the `subscriptions` table in Supabase has the correct schema to store all necessary subscription data.

2. **Test Webhook Processing**: Use the Stripe CLI to manually trigger webhook events and observe if they're properly processed.
   ```bash
   stripe trigger customer.subscription.created
   ```

3. **Implement Manual Subscription Sync**: Create a utility endpoint or function to manually sync subscription data from Stripe to Supabase for specific users.

4. **Add More Robust Error Handling**: Enhance error handling in the webhook handler to better diagnose and recover from issues.

5. **Improve Logging**: Add more detailed logging throughout the subscription flow to better track the data flow and identify where issues might be occurring.

6. **Consider Implementing Idempotency**: Ensure webhook handlers are idempotent to prevent duplicate processing of events.

7. **Review Stripe Event Types**: Make sure all relevant Stripe event types are being handled properly in the webhook handler.

## Conclusion

The Stripe integration has been significantly improved, but there are still issues with subscription data not being properly stored in the database. The next steps focus on diagnosing and fixing these database-related issues to ensure a seamless subscription experience for users.
